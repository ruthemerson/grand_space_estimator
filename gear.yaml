# The following list contains all the gear we're bringing that's significant
# from a storage/rigging perspective. For each item, I have specified count
# (or left it out if there's just one), and also, under 'stow', have estimated 
# What kind of container/space it will be rigged in and how much of such a 
# container one takes up.
